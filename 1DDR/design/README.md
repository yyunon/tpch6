#Creating a Fletcher-based design on the AWS F1 platform

Place your vhdl directory (generated by fletchgen and customized with your design) here.
The other files stays the same.

Then, you need to add a list (in proper compile order) to 2 scripts (1 for synthesis and 1 for simulation):
1) Run 
`vhdeps dump AxiTop > sources.tmp.txt`
`cut -d ' ' -f4 sources.tmp.txt > sources.txt`
to obtain the ordered list of source files.

2) Add "file copy -force $CL_DIR/design " before and "$TARGET_DIR" after each line, 
and place all these entries in the encrypt.tcl file (the place to do it is marked by Amazon).

3) Add ${CL_ROOT}/design before each line, and place all these entries in the verif/scripts/top.vivado.vhdl.f file.
